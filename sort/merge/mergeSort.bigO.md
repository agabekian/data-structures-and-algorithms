### Time Complexity:

Best Case: O(n log n) - This occurs when the input array is already sorted or nearly sorted. In this case, the divide and conquer approach efficiently splits the array into sub-arrays with minimal comparisons needed during merging.

Average Case: O(n log n) - This is the typical behavior for random unsorted arrays. The divide and conquer approach ensures roughly balanced sub-arrays throughout the sorting process, leading to logarithmic (log n) comparisons per level and n levels in total (due to array size reduction with each division).

Worst Case: O(n log n) - This happens when the input array is in reverse order. The division process creates sub-arrays that are already partially sorted in descending order. However, merging these sub-arrays still requires comparisons at each level, resulting in the same overall time complexity as the average case.

### Space Complexity:

Merge Sort: O(n) - The space complexity is dominated by the recursive calls. In the worst case, the recursion tree can have a depth of n (number of elements in the array) due to each division creating sub-arrays. This requires additional space on the call stack for storing function arguments and temporary variables during the recursion. However, the space used is temporary and released as the recursion unwinds.
Breakdown:

The logarithmic (log n) factor in the time complexity comes from the number of comparisons needed during merging at each level of the recursion tree. As the array size doubles (n grows), the number of comparisons only increases logarithmically.
The linear (n) factor in the space complexity accounts for the maximum depth of the recursion tree, which can be n in the worst case.
### Summary:

Merge Sort offers an efficient sorting algorithm with a guaranteed O(n log n) time complexity for most practical scenarios. The balanced divide-and-conquer approach ensures efficient sorting while the space complexity is also manageable due to the temporary nature of the recursion overhead.
