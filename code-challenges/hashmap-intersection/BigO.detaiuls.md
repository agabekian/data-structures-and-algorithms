Combining the Complexities
The function consists of two main traversals:

Traversal of tree1:
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n)
Traversal of tree2:
𝑂
(
𝑚
)
O(m)
Thus, the overall time complexity of the function is:
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
+
𝑂
(
𝑚
)
O(n)+O(m)
Since
𝑛
n and
𝑚
m are independent, the combined time complexity remains
𝑂
(
𝑛
+
𝑚
)
O(n+m).

Space Complexity
Space for the Hashtable:

The hashtable stores up to
𝑛
n entries (one for each unique node value in tree1).
Space complexity for storing these values is
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n).
Space for the Intersection Array:

In the worst case, the intersection array could store up to
min
⁡
(
𝑛
,
𝑚
)
min(n,m) elements (if all elements in the smaller tree intersect with the larger one).
The space complexity for the intersection array is
𝑂
(
min
⁡
(
𝑛
,
𝑚
)
)
O(min(n,m)).
Auxiliary Space for Recursion:

The recursion depth for the in-order traversal of each tree is proportional to the height of the tree.
In the worst case (unbalanced tree), the height is
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n) for tree1 and
𝑂
(
𝑚
)
O(m) for tree2.
In the best case (balanced tree), the height is
𝑂
(
log
⁡
𝑛
)
O(logn) for tree1 and
𝑂
(
log
⁡
𝑚
)
O(logm) for tree2.
Overall, the space complexity is dominated by the storage for the hashtable and the intersection array:
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
+
𝑂
(
min
⁡
(
𝑛
,
𝑚
)
)
O(n)+O(min(n,m))
Given that
min
⁡
(
𝑛
,
𝑚
)
≤
max
⁡
(
𝑛
,
𝑚
)
≤
𝑛
+
𝑚
min(n,m)≤max(n,m)≤n+m, we can simplify this to:
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n)

Summary
Time Complexity:
𝑂
(
𝑛
+
𝑚
)
O(n+m)
Space Complexity:
𝑂
(
𝑛
)
O(n)
These complexities reflect the efficiency of the tree_intersection function, making it performant for typical use cases involving binary trees and hash tables.
